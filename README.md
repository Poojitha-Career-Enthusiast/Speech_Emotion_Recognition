# Speech Emotion Recognition using LSTM

This repository contains an implementation of a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system using LSTM-based neural networks to classify emotions from speech audio signals.

🔹 Overview

Implements a unimodal speech emotion recognition pipeline

Focuses on acoustic features extracted from audio

Uses LSTM to capture the temporal characteristics of speech signals

Designed for scenarios with limited labeled data and moderate computational resources

🔹 Methodology

Audio preprocessing and feature extraction from speech signals

Sequential modeling using LSTM and dense neural network layers

End-to-end training and evaluation of the SER model

🔹 Results

Model performance evaluated using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Results demonstrate the effectiveness of LSTM-based models for speech emotion recognition

🔹 Tools & Technologies

Python, NumPy, TensorFlow/Keras, Librosa, Jupyter Notebook# Speech_Emotion_Recognition
